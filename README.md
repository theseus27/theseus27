## :wave: Hey, thanks for dropping by!
:boy: I'm Theseus, a senior at Tufts University studying computer science and psychology. <br>
:briefcase: I'm currently the Head of Project Management for JumboCode, an organization that works with non-profits to build full-stack bespoke web apps. Last summer I was a Data Analytics intern at Ernst and Young. <br>
:computer: For work, I enjoy data analytics and software engineering that revolves around fixing things. For fun I like scripting and automating my workflow (AutoHotKey, Powershell modules...) <br>
:video_game: Apart from coding, I enjoy drumming, talking about Percy Jackson, and playing Pokemon and COD. <br>
:email: If you want to talk about pretty much anything, feel free to reach out at theseus.lim@gmail.com
