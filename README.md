## About Me
:wave: Hey, thanks for dropping by! <br>
:boy: I'm Theseus, a junior at Tufts University studying computer science and psychology. <br>
:briefcase: I'm currently a Project Manager for JumboCode, working with Boston-based non-profit G{Code} to build a Canvas-esque platform. <br>
:computer: For work, I enjoy coding more software engineering type projects. For fun I like scripting and automating my workflow (AutoHotKey, Powershell modules...) <br>
:video_game: Apart from coding, I enjoy drumming, talking about Percy Jackson, and playing Pokemon and COD. <br>
:email: If you want to talk about pretty much anything, feel free to reach out at theseus.lim@gmail.com
