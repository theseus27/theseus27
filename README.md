## Hello! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Theseus, a junior at Tufts University studying computer science and engineering psychology. I'm currently teaching a cybersecurity class at iD Tech's MIT Academy. On the side, I'm learning React and FastAPI for my summer project in preparation for my role as a Project Manager at Jumbo Code this coming year. Apart from coding, I enjoy drumming, playing Pokemon, and talking about Percy Jackson.
