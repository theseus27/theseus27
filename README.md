## About Me
:wave: Hey, thanks for dropping by!
I'm Theseus, a junior at Tufts University studying computer science and psychology.
I'm currently a Project Manager for JumboCode, working with Boston-based non-profit G{Code} to build a Canvas-esque platform.
For 'work', I enjoy coding more software engineering type projects
For fun I like scripting and automating my workflow (AutoHotKey, Powershell modules...)
Apart from coding, I enjoy drumming, playing Pokemon, and talking about Percy Jackson. 
If you want to talk about pretty much anything, feel free to reach out at theseus.lim@gmail.com
